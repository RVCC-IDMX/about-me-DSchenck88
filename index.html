<!-- More detailed bio -->
                <p>My name is Darin Schenck, and I was born and raised in Franklin Township in Somerset, New Jersey. I currently have a Bachelor's Degree in Media & Film: Broadcasting from Kean University in Union, NJ. I did attempt to pursue a career in film, working as a videographer on several independent projects, but I am now seeking a new, more stable career path.</p>
                <p>I'm not 100% sure what I want to be, but I've always wanted to work with computers. Even working on films, I was always interested in the post production. I'm also an avid gamer, currently playing Sifu on my Steam Deck. I previously attended Raritan Valley Community College from 2007 - 2009 and received an Associates degree in Liberal Arts - Communication. I was looking into the Data Science field of study to further my education, but my major is currently Info Systems & Tech here at Raritan because they do not offer a Data Science program.</p>

            <h2>What is Google Maps' iFrame?</h2>

            <div>
                <p>
                    For my Web Dev 1 About Me Final Project web page, I chose to learn about embedding a static Google map using iFrame. I honestly never really paid attention to the Google Maps embed code, but apparently, iFrame is what makes it possible. It is a sort of digital frame that holds and displays the map in a neat way on your webpage. Imagine a map of the whole world, (because Google Maps does map out the whole world) and this iFrame tool grabs a small part of the world for you to view on your web page.
                    <p>In the language of the web, the "src" attribute of the iFrame is crucial. It's like giving the iFrame the exact address (URL) of the Google map you want to display. It's similar to telling someone the exact coordinates of a location so they can find it on a physical map.
                    Customization is another cool feature. You can adjust settings like zoom level, map type, and where to place a marker on the map. It's like customizing the appearance of a picture frame to match your room's style – you want it to fit in seamlessly with the rest of your website.</p>
                    <p>Think of the iFrame as a flexible container. It adjusts its size based on the map you put inside it, making sure it looks good on different devices – be it a big computer screen or a small phone screen. This adaptability is crucial to keep your map looking sharp no matter how someone is viewing your webpage.</p>
                    <p>To make all of this work, you first need a kind of digital permission slip. This is where the API key comes into play – it's the secret code that makes sure your map shows up properly inside the iFrame. It's like the key to the Google map kingdom, allowing your website to communicate with Google's mapping system. It is Google’s main security measure for this feature, and it acts as a kind of digital signature. It ensures that only your website is allowed to use the Google map you've chosen. Without this key, your website won't be able to smoothly embed the map.</p>
                    <p>I didn’t know anything about this before doing this project, I thought anybody could just embed Google Maps like any other widget. I did run into this obstacle while trying to sign up with Google to gain access to an API Key, but once I figured it out I was able to embed the map to the webpage.</p>
                    <p>In a nutshell, embedding a static Google map using an iFrame is like framing a picture. The iFrame is your digital frame, the API key is your special access pass, and the "src" attribute is the address of the map. Customization lets you tweak how the map looks, and the API key ensures it's all secure. Finally, the iFrame's adaptability ensures your map looks great on any device.
                    <p>So, if you look below you can see a quick view of my hometown, Somerset, New Jersey, as made possible using the iFrame embedding tool by Google Maps</p>

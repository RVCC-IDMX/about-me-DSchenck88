The purpose of this project is to help the world get to know a little bit about Darin Schenck through this simple blog page. I show a bit of my photography that I had printed on to canvas because I thought it looked cool. I included a short YouTube video of me ranting about Iron Man. I talk a little bit about where I'm from, and then I show the readers a Google Maps view of where I'm from.
